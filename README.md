[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2025.109290-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2025.109290)

This repository contains relevant code and materials supporting the following paper (also nicknamed the "NPRL CogMap Paper"):

Bassil, Y., Kanukolanu, A., Funderburg, E., Brown, T., & Borich, M. R. (2026). Formation of allocentric representations after exposure to a novel, naturalistic, city-like, virtual reality environment. *Neuropsychologia, 220,* 109290. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2025.109290

All data for this paper can be found on the associated [CogMap OSF Project](https://osf.io/7dfcu/overview).

This repository contains all analysis code, figures, and statistical tests associated with this study. The project examines how individuals develop allocentric (i.e., world-centered) spatial representations after exploring a novel, virtual reality, city-like environment.

## Folder Structure

### `data/`

Contains raw and processed data files used for all analyses in the paper.

### `data_analysis/`

Contains scripts for processing and analyzing raw data from the NavCity task and other behavioral measures. These scripts generate the outcome variables and performance metrics used in the main analyses.

### `figure_creation/`

Contains all scripts used to generate the main figures that appear in the published paper. Each script corresponds to a specific figure and produces publication-ready visualizations.

### `other_figures/`

Contains supplementary figures, exploratory analyses, and additional visualizations that may not appear in the main manuscript but were created during the analysis process.

### `stat_tests/`

Contains scripts for all statistical tests reported in the paper, including:
- Hypothesis testing
- Model comparisons
- Post-hoc analyses
- Statistical validations

### `writing/`

Contains manuscript drafts, supplementary materials, and other written components related to the paper.

# README

Welcome to the repository for **"Formation of allocentric representations after spatial navigation training in a novel, naturalistic, city-like, virtual reality environment"** (also nicknamed the NPRL "CogMap Paper").

This repository contains all analysis code, figures, and statistical tests associated with this study. The project examines how individuals develop allocentric (world-centered) spatial representations after exploring a novel virtual reality city environment.

Below is an explanation of the folder structure in this repository. Feel free to reach out to the Neural Plasticity Research Lab via our [website](https://npresearchlab.com) or contact Yasmine Bassil at [ybassil@emory.edu](mailto:ybassil@emory.edu) with any questions.

## Folder Structure

### `data/`

Contains raw and processed data files used for all analyses in the paper.

### `data_analysis/`

Contains scripts for processing and analyzing raw data from the NavCity task and other behavioral measures. These scripts generate the outcome variables and performance metrics used in the main analyses.

### `figure_creation/`

Contains all scripts used to generate the main figures that appear in the published paper. Each script corresponds to a specific figure and produces publication-ready visualizations.

### `other_figures/`

Contains supplementary figures, exploratory analyses, and additional visualizations that may not appear in the main manuscript but were created during the analysis process.

### `stat_tests/`

Contains scripts for all statistical tests reported in the paper, including:
- Hypothesis testing
- Model comparisons
- Post-hoc analyses
- Statistical validations

### `writing/`

Contains manuscript drafts, supplementary materials, and other written components related to the paper.

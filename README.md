Welcome to the repository for the paper ***"Formation of allocentric representations after exposure to a novel, naturalistic, city-like, virtual reality environment"*** (also nicknamed the NPRL "CogMap Paper"). 

The project examines how individuals develop allocentric (i.e., world-centered) spatial representations after exploring a novel, virtual reality, city-like environment.

## Overview

This repository provides complete reproducibility materials for our study examining the formation of allocentric (i.e., world-centered) spatial representations following exposure to a novel, naturalistic, city-like virtual reality environment (*NavCity*). The study investigates how individuals develop cognitive maps and acquire spatial knowledge through immersive navigation training in an ecologically valid virtual environment.

**Key Features:**
- Complete analysis pipeline from raw data to final figures
- Statistical analysis scripts
- Publication-ready figures

## Data

### `data/`

All data for this paper can be found on the associated [CogMap OSF Project](https://osf.io/7dfcu/overview).

---

## Code

### `data_analysis/`

Contains scripts for processing and analyzing raw data from the *NavCity* task and other behavioral measures. These scripts generate the outcome variables and performance metrics used in the main analyses.

- **`0_runall.ipynb`**: Master orchestration script
  - Runs all analysis scripts (labeled 1 through 6) in sequence
  - Processes raw *NavCity* data files
  - Generates block-specific and session-averaged metrics
  - Outputs cleaned datasets for statistical analysis

**⚠️ Important**: This file contains hardcoded file paths. You must update file paths before running on your local machine. To get started, you may set the following:
  - Line 5: Set your local data directory for your data
  - Line 6: Set your local data directory for your code (scripts 0 through 6)

Outputs from analysis scripts will be located in the *parent directory* of the YA data and OA data, respectively.

**To Run the Complete Pipeline:**
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages (see [Requirements](#requirements))
3. Update file paths in `0_runall.ipynb`
4. Run all cells in `0_runall.ipynb`

### `figure_creation/`

Contains all scripts used to generate the main figures that appear in the published paper. Each script corresponds to a specific figure and produces publication-ready visualizations.

### `stat_tests/`

Contains scripts for all statistical tests reported in the paper, including:
- Running models
- Comparing outputs
- Post-hoc analyses
- Statistical validations

---

## Figures

### `/final_figures/`

This directory contains publication-ready figures in high-resolution formats (PNG, PDF, SVG).

All figures follow journal specifications:
- 300+ DPI resolution
- Colorblind-friendly palettes
- Clear axis labels and legends
